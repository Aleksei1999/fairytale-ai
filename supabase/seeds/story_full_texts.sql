-- Story 1: The Magic Emotion Map (The Magic Backpack and First Sparks)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Once upon a time, there lived a brave and curious Hero. And their name was {childName}.

One evening, when eyes were already closing and the blanket became soft as a cloud, {childName} set off on a journey. They found themselves on a meadow in the Magical Forest.

The grass here was ticklish and fluffy, and the trees rustled as if whispering fairy tales.
Suddenly, right in the middle of the meadow, our Hero saw something unusual. It was a Backpack. But not an ordinary one that you take to school - a magical one. It shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow and glowed softly.

{childName} came closer. They were very curious. They reached out and slightly opened the backpack.
WHOOSH!
A bright, golden Yellow Spark flew out of the backpack. It swirled around the Hero like a sunbeam and laughed merrily: "Hee-hee-hee!"
The Hero immediately wanted to jump, run, and laugh out loud. Their feet felt light, and inside their tummy, it became ticklish and warm.

"Hello!" chimed the Spark. "I am your Joy."
"Joy?" {childName} was surprised. "What do I need you for?"
"I''m here to make you smile!" answered the Spark. "I come when you eat yummy ice cream, when mom hugs you, or when you build the tallest tower. I help you shine!"

{childName} caught the Yellow Spark in their palms, but it didn''t burn - it was warm like sunshine.

But then another Spark peeked out from the backpack. It was Blue, quiet, and very slow. It didn''t jump around but floated gently through the air like an autumn leaf.
"Oh..." sighed the Spark.
{childName} immediately stopped jumping. They wanted to sit down, wrap up in a blanket, and just sit quietly.
"Who are you?" asked the Hero. "You must be mean since I don''t feel like laughing because of you?"
"No," the Spark answered softly. "I''m not mean. I am your Sadness."
"But why do I need Sadness?" asked {childName}. "I only want Joy!"

And then the Magical Backpack spoke in a wise, deep voice:
"Don''t rush, Hero. Sadness is a very important friend."
"Really?" the child was surprised.
"Of course. When you''re tired, Sadness helps you calm down and rest. When something hurts or a toy breaks, Sadness helps you cry. Tears wash away all the bad, and you feel better. Sadness helps mom understand that you need comfort and a tight hug."

{childName} looked at the Blue Spark. It no longer seemed bad. It was cozy and calm.
"Come to me, Sadness," said the Hero and placed it on their shoulder.
And on the other shoulder sat the cheerful Joy.

"Now I know your secret," said {childName}. "You both live inside me. Sometimes I''m yellow and happy, and sometimes I''m blue and quiet. And that''s okay."

The Hero carefully put the Sparks back into the Magical Backpack. They curled up there and fell asleep.
"Sleep, my emotions," whispered {childName}. "Tomorrow we''ll go for a walk again."

The meadow began to fade, and our Hero found themselves back in their soft bed. They felt warm and peaceful. They knew that inside them was a whole magical world where kind friends lived.

Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 1;

-- Story 2: Island of Joy (The Fiery Protector)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Evening fell in the Magical Forest. The stars in the sky lit up like little lanterns. Our Hero, {childName}, closed their eyes and found themselves in the Magical Forest again.

This time the forest was very quiet. {childName} walked along the path and checked their Magical Backpack. Inside, Yellow Joy and Blue Sadness were peacefully sleeping.

Suddenly, a big stone appeared on the path. {childName} didn''t notice it and... BAM! They tripped and hurt their knee.
"Ow-ow-ow!" exclaimed the Hero.
It hurt and felt unfair. "What a stupid stone! Why is it lying here?!"

And then, with a loud hiss - PSSHH! - a new Spark flew out of the backpack.
It was Bright Red, like fire in a fireplace. It didn''t float gently - it jumped sharply and quickly: Hop! Hop! It was hot and very loud.
"Grrr!" growled the Red Spark. "Who hurt my Hero?! Go away, bad stone!"
The Spark started to swell and grow bigger and bigger. It became like a small ball of fire.

{childName} was scared at first.
"Oh, Backpack!" they cried. "This spark is so hot! It''s going to burn everything! Let''s chase it away! It''s mean!"

"Don''t be afraid," came the calm voice of the Magical Backpack again. "This isn''t an enemy. This is your Anger."
"But it''s yelling and stomping its feet!" said {childName}. "Is that good?"
"Look carefully," answered the Backpack. "It''s yelling at the stone. It wants to protect you."
The Red Spark flew to the Hero''s knee and looked around angrily, checking if there were any other dangers nearby.
"I am your Strength," crackled the Spark like a coal in a bonfire. "If someone takes your toy, if someone pushes or hurts you - I come to say a loud ''STOP!'' I help you be brave."

{childName} was surprised. They always thought being angry was bad. Mom sometimes said: "Don''t be upset!" But it turns out the Red Spark just wants to keep them safe.

The Hero reached toward the Red Spark. But didn''t grab it (it''s hot after all!) - just held their palm nearby to feel the warmth.
"Thank you, Anger," said {childName}. "You''re my Protector. I see you''re strong. But now the stone isn''t dangerous anymore. We can rest."

Hearing the kind words, the Spark stopped growling and shrank. From a huge ball, it turned into a small, warm flame, like candlelight. It no longer burned, just gave cozy warmth.
It turned out that if you befriend Anger, it becomes not a wildfire, but a warm hearth.

{childName} placed the Red Spark in the backpack.
"Move over, please," they asked Joy and Sadness. "Our Protector has arrived."
The Sparks settled down side by side. Now the backpack was cheerful, calm, and safe.

Our Hero rubbed their hurt knee - it barely hurt anymore. They took a deep breath, covered themselves with the soft blanket of dreams, and fell asleep.

Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 2;

-- Story 3: Island of Sadness (The Mystery of the Rustling in the Bushes)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Quiet, quiet, evening descends on the Magical Forest. Our Hero, {childName}, found themselves on the familiar meadow again.

The Backpack on their back glowed with a cozy light. Inside, Yellow Joy, Blue Sadness, and Red Anger-Flame were softly snoring.
{childName} walked forward, humming a song. But suddenly...
Rustle-rustle-rustle!
A strange, unfamiliar sound came from the dark bushes.

The Hero froze. Their heart started beating fast: Thump-thump-thump! Their feet seemed glued to the ground.
And then the backpack trembled. A new Spark didn''t fly out but fearfully peeked out.
It was Purple, looking like a twilight shadow. It was shaking like an aspen leaf in the wind, and it had big, big eyes.
The Spark didn''t fly forward like Anger. Instead, it quickly darted behind {childName}''s back and whispered:
"Oh-oh-oh! Don''t go there! It''s dangerous! There''s something scary there! Let''s run!"

{childName} also wanted to run.
"Who are you?" they asked in a whisper. "Are you Cowardice?"
"No," the Spark trembled, hiding behind the Hero''s ear. "I am your Fear. I come to warn you. What if there''s a pit? Or an angry wolf? Or a hot iron? I watch with both eyes to make sure nothing happens to you!"

The Magical Backpack added:
"Listen to her, Hero. Fear is your Scout. It helps you be careful and not touch dangerous things. But sometimes Fear has ''eyes bigger than its belly'' and gets scared of things that aren''t dangerous at all."
"So what should I do?" asked {childName}. "Run?"
"No," answered the Backpack. "You need to check. Turn on your Flashlight of Courage."

{childName} took a deep breath (let''s breathe together: inhale-exhale). They took the Purple Spark by its small trembling hand and said:
"Thank you for warning me. You''re very attentive. But let''s look together to see who''s rustling there?"

They slowly approached the bush. The Spark was shaking and covering its eyes with its hands.
The Hero parted the branches and...
Saw a little, funny hedgehog! The hedgehog was sniffling and carrying a mushroom on its needles. Sniff-sniff!
"Oh!" the Purple Spark opened its eyes. "It''s not a monster?"
"No," laughed {childName}. "It''s just a hedgehog!"

The Spark immediately stopped trembling. It straightened its shoulders and even smiled a little.
"Phew," it exhaled. "Well, okay then. But I''ll still make sure you don''t touch its needles! They''re sharp!"
"Deal," said the Hero. "You''ll be my Caution."

{childName} placed the Purple Spark in the backpack.
"Now I have a complete team," they thought.
If it''s fun - Yellow Joy will come.
If I''m tired - Blue Sadness will come.
If someone hurts me - Red Anger will come.
And if something is unclear and dangerous - Purple Fear will come and say: "Be careful!"

With such friends, nothing is scary. You can sleep peacefully.
The forest grew quiet. The hedgehog ran off on its business, and our Hero went off to the sweetest dreams.

Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 3;

-- Story 4: Tears are Okay (Map of My Body)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Evening in the Magical Forest. {childName} sat on a stump and examined their hands and feet.
The Backpack on their back stirred.
"What are you doing, Hero?" it asked.
"I''m looking at myself," said {childName}. "Hands are just hands, tummy is just tummy. Nothing special."
"Oh-oh-oh," the Backpack drawled. "Your body is the smartest home for the sparks. They don''t just sit inside me - they love to run around your body! Do you want to know where they hide?"

The Backpack took out a magical magnifying glass.
"Let''s call Fear (the Purple spark)," suggested the Backpack.
The Purple spark jumped out and... whoosh! - hid in {childName}''s heels.
"Oh!" the Hero laughed. "My heels want to run!"
Then the spark jumped into the tummy. The tummy clenched, and it became cold inside, as if butterflies were flying.
"See?" said the Backpack. "When you''re scared, your feet want to run, and your tummy clenches. Your body is telling you: ''Be careful!''"

Then Anger (the Red spark) jumped out. It leaped into the fists. The fists clenched tight-tight by themselves! Then it jumped into the cheeks, and they became hot, like fresh pies from the oven.
"Wow!" exhaled {childName}. "I''m hot! I''m strong!"
"That''s Anger preparing you for defense," explained the Backpack.

And then Joy (the Yellow spark) flew out. It settled right in the chest. It became warm there, free, and they wanted to take in lots of air: Inhaaale!
"It''s like a balloon inflated inside!" the Hero was delighted.

{childName} stroked their tummy, their hands, and their chest.
"Thank you, body," they said. "Now I''ll listen to you. If my fists clench - it means Anger came. If my tummy feels cold - it means Fear is here. I hear you."

{childName} closed their eyes and felt warmth (Joy) spreading through their whole body, lulling them to sleep.

Goodnight, Hero.' WHERE id = 4;

-- Story 5: Joy Sharing (Weather in the Sky)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Today in the Magical Forest it was cloudy. Gray drops fell from the sky: Drip... Drip... Drip...
Our Hero, {childName}, sat under the cap of a big toadstool to stay dry. They felt uncomfortable.
Next to them on their shoulder sat the Blue Spark (Sadness). It was sighing and looking at the puddles.
"Well, that''s it," {childName} said sadly. "The rain keeps falling and falling. Now it''ll always be wet and gray. We''ll never go for a walk again."

The Magical Backpack, hanging on a dry branch, suddenly glowed softly and asked:
"Hero, look up. What do you see?"
{childName} raised their head.
"I see gray clouds. They''ve covered all the sun. There''s no more sun!" - and the Hero almost started to cry.

"You''re wrong," the Backpack said gently. "The sun hasn''t gone anywhere. It''s just waiting behind the clouds. And you know the secret? You are not the clouds. You are the Sky."
"I am the Sky?" {childName} was surprised.
"Yes. Imagine that you are huge, blue, endless sky.
Your emotions are the weather.
Here comes a cloud of Sadness. Drip-drip. Rain falls.
Here comes a wind of Anger. Whooo! Thunder rumbles.
And here comes the sunshine of Joy.

The weather always changes. Clouds come and go. And the Sky? The Sky always stays in place. It''s always calm and blue, even if you can''t see it right now behind the clouds."

{childName} closed their eyes and imagined being a big blue Sky.
Suddenly a light breeze blew.
"Look!" cried the Backpack.
The wind started moving the gray clouds. They floated like cotton ships. Floating... Floating...
The rain grew quieter.
And suddenly - Ding! - a bright golden ray broke through between the clouds.
Right along this ray, as if sliding down a hill, came the Yellow Spark (Joy).
"Yay!" it shouted. "Puddles! We can float paper boats!"

The Blue Spark (Sadness) smiled, became transparent, and flew away with a cloud to rest. In its place came the Sun.
{childName} climbed out from under the mushroom. The forest sparkled, drops on the leaves glittered like diamonds. The air was fresh and delicious.
"You were right, Backpack," said the Hero. "The rain ended."
"Remember this," the Backpack replied. "When you feel sad or scared, just tell yourself: ''This is just a cloud. It will pass. And I will remain.''"

{childName} lay down in their warm bed. They felt huge and calm, like the sky. Let dreams come and go like clouds. And they will sleep tight-tight.

Goodnight, my dear Sky. Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 5;

-- Story 6: The Emotion Weather (The Magic Remote)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'The evening in the Magical Forest was quiet and starry. Our Hero, {childName}, was walking along the path and suddenly tripped over some little box.
It was shiny, with one big round button in the middle. On the button were numbers: a small one (1), a medium five (5), and a huge red ten (10).

"What''s this?" the Hero wondered.
The Magical Backpack behind their back answered:
"Oh! This is a very rare thing. This is the Feelings Volume Remote."
"Can feelings be made louder or quieter?" asked {childName}. "Like a TV?"
"Of course," said the Backpack. "Let''s try. Call the Yellow Spark."

Joy flew out. The Hero turned the dial to number 1.
Joy quietly smiled and just sat nearby. It was cozy and calm.
The Hero turned the dial to number 5.
Joy started giggling, bouncing, and clapping hands. They felt like playing!
The Hero turned the dial to the red 10!
Wow! Joy started cartwheeling, squealing, tumbling, and laughing so loud that leaves fell from the trees!
"Oh, so loud!" laughed {childName}. "My ears are even ringing!"

"Now let''s try with Anger," suggested the Backpack. "But be careful."
The Red Spark flew out.
At number 1, it just frowned and crossed its arms. "Hmm, I don''t like this," it grumbled.
At number 5, it stomped its foot and said loudly: "I''m angry! Give back my toy!" It got hotter.
And then the Hero accidentally touched the dial, and it cranked to 10!
KABOOM!
The Red spark turned into a huge fiery volcano! It screamed, stomped, waved its fists, and couldn''t see anything around.
{childName} got scared.
"Backpack! It can''t hear me! It''s going to break everything!"
"Of course," the Backpack shouted through the noise. "At ten, Anger controls you! Quick, turn down the volume!"
"But how? The dial is stuck!"
"Breathe!" the Backpack suggested. "Your breath is the oil for the dial."

{childName} took a deep breath through their nose... and a slow exhale through their mouth (like blowing out a candle). Whooo...
The dial on the remote creaked and turned back.
The volcano became smaller.
The Hero breathed in again. Whooo...
The needle dropped to 5. The Red Spark stopped screaming. It just stood there breathing heavily.
"Phew," said the Hero. "It worked."

{childName} put the remote in their pocket.
"Remember, Hero," said the Backpack. "Being angry is okay. But it''s better to notice Anger when it''s at one or five. Then you are the Boss. When it''s at ten - it''s the Boss."
"I understand," nodded {childName}. "If it gets too hot, I''ll breathe and turn the dial back."

Now the Hero knew they controlled themselves. They patted their sparks and yawned sweetly.

Goodnight, Boss of your feelings. Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 6;

-- Story 7: The Anger Volcano (Dance of the Angry Dragon)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'It was sunny in the Magical Forest. Our Hero, {childName}, sat on the meadow building a tall tower of magical blocks.
One block, two, three... The tower was already taller than the Hero!
They held their breath to place the top piece.
But then a clumsy beetle flew by. It bumped the tower with its wing, and...
CRASH!
The blocks scattered everywhere. The tower was ruined.

Inside {childName}, everything flared up.
The Red Spark (Anger) burst out of the Backpack with a roar. It was huge, hot, and crackling like a bonfire.
The Hero''s hands clenched into fists by themselves. They wanted to kick the blocks! They wanted to yell at the beetle! They wanted to hit someone!
"Grrr!" growled the Hero.

"Stop!" the Magical Backpack said firmly.
"I can''t!" shouted {childName}. "The Anger is so big! It''s about to explode! I want to hit this stump!"

"You can''t hit others," said the Backpack. "It will hurt them."
"Then should I keep it inside?" asked the Hero, trying to cover their mouth with their hand.
"No!" answered the Backpack. "If you swallow Anger, your tummy will hurt. Anger is like hot steam in a kettle. You need to let it out, but so no one gets burned."

"But how?" the Hero wondered. The Spark kept burning their palms.
"Let''s dance the Dragon Dance," suggested the Backpack.

1. Stomping.
"Stand firm on your feet," commanded the Backpack. "Now stomp hard-hard! Like a huge heavy dragon! STOMP-STOMP-STOMP! Pound your anger into the ground!"
{childName} started stomping. The ground rumbled. They liked it. The strength went into their heels.

2. Roar into a cave.
"Now," said the Backpack, "Anger wants to scream. But you can''t scream at others. Take this empty jar (or pillow). This will be your ''Screaming Cave.''"
The Hero brought the jar to their mouth and breathed out with all their might:
"AAAA-RRRR!!!"
The sound stayed in the jar and didn''t scare anyone.

3. Paper tearing.
"Now," - the Spark was still red - "let''s tear something! But not a book and not clothes."
The Backpack gave the Hero an old dry burdock leaf.
"Tear it!"
RIP! The Hero satisfyingly tore the leaf into tiny pieces and tossed them up.

{childName} stopped. They were breathing deep and fast: Huff... Huff...
They looked at their hands - the fists had unclenched.
They looked at the Red Spark. It was no longer a fire. It was again a small, obedient flame.
"How are you?" asked the Backpack.
"I feel light," the Hero smiled. "The anger came out through my feet and through the roar. I don''t want to fight anymore."

The Hero gathered the blocks. Now they were calm.
"Thank you, Anger, for giving me strength," they said.
They started building a new tower, even better than before. And even if it falls - they know what to do. They''ll just dance the Dragon Dance.

Goodnight, strong and wise {childName}.' WHERE id = 7;

-- Story 8: What Fear Tells Us (Lake of Tears and Warm Blanket)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'It was a quiet evening in the Magical Forest. Our Hero, {childName}, was walking on the meadow with their favorite red balloon. The balloon bounced happily on its string.
But suddenly a sharp wind blew. WHOOSH!
The string slipped from their hands. The balloon flew high-high into the sky, above the treetops.
{childName} jumped, tried to catch it, but couldn''t reach. The balloon flew away forever.

The Hero stood with an empty palm. Their nose started to sting. A prickly lump appeared in their throat.
The Blue Spark (Sadness) slowly floated out of the Backpack. It was big, heavy, and wet. It sat on the Hero''s shoulders like a heavy, wet towel.
"My balloon..." whispered {childName}.
They wanted to cry, but they thought: "Heroes don''t cry." They tried to chase away the Blue Spark.

"Don''t chase it away," the Magical Backpack said softly. "You hurt because you loved your balloon. That''s normal."
"But I don''t want to cry!" the Hero sniffled.
"Tears are water that washes away the sadness," explained the Backpack. "If you don''t let them out, they''ll get stuck inside and make it hard to breathe. Let''s cry together."

{childName} let themselves cry.
Drip-drip-drip... First the tears fell slowly, then flowed like a stream.
The Blue Spark hugged the Hero.
Where the tears fell on the grass, beautiful blue flowers started blooming - forget-me-nots.
"See?" said the Backpack. "Your sadness waters the flowers. It needs time to flow out."

The Hero cried a little more. And suddenly they felt that the prickly lump in their throat was gone. Breathing became easier. The Blue Spark became smaller and lighter.

"I cried out my sadness," sighed {childName}. "But I still feel cold and lonely without my balloon."
"Now for the most important magic," said the Backpack. "The magic of the Warm Blanket."
"But I don''t have a blanket," the Hero was surprised.
"It''s always with you. It''s your hands."

"Do this: cross your arms on your chest," commanded the Backpack. "Put your palms on your shoulders. Tight-tight! And hug yourself. Strong-strong, like you''re hugging your best friend. And sway: left-right, left-right."

{childName} hugged themselves. They felt the warmth of their own palms. They swayed, like mom rocks a baby. It became so cozy. As if someone big and kind said: "I''m with you, everything will be okay."
"I have myself," thought the Hero. "And I love myself."

The Hero looked at the sky. The balloon was no longer visible. It was a little sad, but no longer painful.
"Bye, balloon!" shouted {childName}. "Thank you for playing with me!"
They wiped away the last tears. Now they knew: if something is lost, first you need to cry (to let out the pain), and then tightly hug yourself (to warm up).

With the feeling of a warm hug inside, our Hero went off to sleep.

Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 8;

-- Story 9: The Feelings Check-In (Funny Monster in Pink Socks)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Night came. In {childName}''s room it got dark.
The Hero lay in bed and looked into the corner. There stood a chair with clothes on it.
But in the dark, the chair didn''t look like a chair at all. It looked like a huge dark Creature with long arms!

The Purple Spark (Fear) jumped out of the Backpack.
"Oh-oh-oh!" it trembled, hiding under the blanket. "Look! There''s a Monster! It has teeth! It wants to eat us! Run!"
The Hero''s heart started pounding: Thump-thump-thump! They wanted to cover up head and stop breathing.

"Wait," the Magical Backpack said calmly. "Don''t hide. Fear is afraid of the dark, but there''s something that even monsters are afraid of."
"What?" whispered {childName}. "A sword? Fire?"
"No," the Backpack smiled. "They''re afraid of Laughter. A monster is only strong while it''s scary. If it becomes funny - it disappears."

"But it''s scary!" objected the Hero.
"Turn on your Imagination," suggested the Backpack. "Imagine we have Magic Laugh Glasses. Shall we put them on?"
{childName} pretend-put invisible glasses on their nose. Click!

The Hero looked at the Dark Creature in the corner through the magic glasses.
"Let''s dress it up!" suggested the Backpack. "What''s the funniest thing you can think of?"
"Hmm..." the Hero thought. "Pink underpants with polka dots!"
WHOOSH!
Right over the Creature''s dark arms appeared huge, bright pink underpants with green polka dots.
The Purple Spark (Fear) peeked from under the blanket:
"Hee-hee," it squeaked.

"More!" {childName} got excited. "Let it have roller skates on its feet! And a red clown ball on its nose!"
WHOOSH! WHOOSH!
The Creature wobbled. Now it wasn''t a scary monster but a clumsy clown in underpants, rolling apart in different directions on skates.
"Oh, hold me!" the Creature seemed to say and plopped on its bottom. Thud!

{childName} laughed out loud.
The Purple Spark (Fear) also came out and started laughing, holding its tummy. It wasn''t shaking anymore. It was glowing bright and happy.
"It''s not scary at all!" the Spark shouted. "It''s funny!"
And as soon as the Hero laughed, the Creature dissolved. In the corner stood just a chair with clothes again. No teeth, no arms.
Laughter chased away the darkness.

The Hero took off the invisible glasses and put them under the pillow.
"Now I know the secret," said {childName}. "If I have a bad dream or see a shadow, I''ll just dress it in a clown costume."
"Right," said the Backpack. "Your imagination is stronger than any fear."

The Purple Spark curled up cozily. Now it knew: if anything happens - we''ll laugh.

Goodnight, bravest and funniest Hero.
Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 9;

-- Story 10: Reading Faces (The Riddle of the Sad Squirrel)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Our Hero, {childName}, came to the Sunny Meadow. They were in a wonderful mood! Inside, the Yellow Spark (Joy) was bouncing. They wanted to run, make noise, and play tag.
Suddenly under a hazel bush, they saw a little fluffy Squirrel. She sat with her back to them, curled up in a ball.

"Hi, Squirrel!" {childName} shouted happily. "You''re it! Catch me!"
They ran up and gently tugged her fluffy tail.
But the Squirrel didn''t run. She flinched, turned away even more, and quietly sniffled her nose.

The Hero was surprised.
"Backpack," they asked. "Why isn''t she playing? Is she mean? I''m sharing my joy, and she''s silent!"
"Quiet," whispered the Magical Backpack. "She''s not mean. Look at her carefully. Turn on your Detective."
"But where should I look?" asked the Hero.
"Look at the Face and the Body."

{childName} quietly went around the bush and looked at the Squirrel''s face.

1. Her ears were hanging down like wilted flowers.
2. The corners of her mouth were turned down.
3. Her shoulders were shaking.
4. And tears were dripping from her eyes. Drip-drip.

"Oh," the Hero realized. "I know this! When my shoulders droop and tears flow like that... it means the Blue Spark came to me."
"Right," said the Backpack. "That''s Sadness. The Squirrel is feeling very bad right now. If you pull her tail and shout, she''ll feel even worse."

"So what should I do?" {childName} was confused.
"Just tell her that you see her sadness," the Backpack advised. "That''s called Understanding."

The Hero sat down on their haunches nearby. They stopped shouting. They said very quietly:
"Squirrel, I see you''re crying. Are you sad?"
The Squirrel raised her wet eyes. She was very surprised.
"Yes..." she whispered. "I lost my favorite golden nut."
"I understand you," said {childName}. "The Blue Spark came to me too when I lost my balloon. It''s very upsetting."

The Squirrel wiped her nose with her paw. She suddenly felt better. Not because the nut was found, but because the Hero understood her. She was no longer alone.
"You really understand?" she asked.
"Really," the Hero nodded. "Want me to sit with you? Or should we look for the nut together?"

The Squirrel smiled weakly.
"Let''s look," she said.
They parted the grass and - hooray! - right under a leaf, the golden side of the nut gleamed.
The Squirrel''s ears immediately perked up! Her mouth stretched into a smile.
"Hooray!" she shouted. "Now I have Yellow Joy inside! Thank you, Hero!"

They happily played tag, and then the Hero went home.
"You did an important thing today," said the Backpack. "You saw someone else''s trouble and didn''t walk past. That''s what a real Friend is."

Falling asleep, {childName} decided: tomorrow at kindergarten they would look carefully at the children''s faces.

Goodnight, caring Hero. Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 10;

-- Story 11: Body Clues (Magic Bubble and the Pushy Bear)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Our Hero, {childName}, was sitting in a sandbox on a wonderful forest meadow. They were very busy. They were building a nice garage for their favorite toy car.
They felt calm and interested. The Yellow Spark (Joy) sat nearby and helped smooth the sand.

Suddenly, Pushy Bear came running onto the meadow. He was cheerful but very big, loud, and clumsy.
"Oh! Sand!" shouted Bear. "I want some too!"
And he jumped right next to the Hero with a running start.
SMACK!
Bear sat so close he leaned on the Hero''s shoulder. The garage wall crumbled. And Bear himself grabbed the Hero''s car:
"Vroom-vroom! Let''s go!"

Inside {childName}, the Red Spark (Anger) flared up.
They felt crowded and hot. Bear was breathing right in their ear. He broke the garage! And took the car without asking!
The Hero''s hands clenched into fists by themselves. They wanted to push Bear with all their might!
"Go away!" they wanted to shout.

But then the Magical Backpack stirred:
"Stop, Hero! You don''t need to fight. But you also can''t just put up with it when you''re uncomfortable."
"But he leaned on me!" {childName} whispered resentfully. "And took my thing!"
"That''s because your Magic Bubble is turned off," said the Backpack. "Bear can''t see where you end and where he begins. Turn on the protection!"

"But how?" asked the Hero.
"Close your eyes," whispered the Backpack. "And imagine that around you there''s a transparent, shining ball. Like a big soap bubble. This is your House. No one can come in without an invitation."

{childName} imagined a beautiful, strong bubble around themselves. It felt cozy. They felt like the master of their own house.

"And now," commanded the Backpack, "make the Protector Gesture. Put your palm forward, right in front of Bear''s nose. And say firmly and loudly: ''STOP!''"

The Hero stretched out their hand. And said loudly:
"STOP!"

Pushy Bear froze in surprise with the car in his paws. He even opened his mouth.
"Don''t come so close," {childName} said firmly, not taking their palm away. "I feel crowded. And that''s my car. Please put it back."

Bear blinked. He didn''t mean to be bad at all, he just didn''t think. But when he was told "Stop," he immediately understood.
"Oh, sorry," said Bear. "I didn''t mean to push you."
He carefully put the car on the sand and moved further away.
"Can I play here, close by?" he asked politely. "Outside your bubble?"

The Hero looked at their invisible Bubble. It was whole. No one was pushing anymore.
The Red Spark (Anger) nodded contentedly and hid. It saw that the Hero protected themselves with words, and there was no need to fight.
"You can," smiled {childName}. "Build over here."

They played great, but now Bear didn''t push.
In the evening, falling asleep in their bed, the Hero checked their Magic Bubble.
"This is my territory," they thought. "I decide who I let close and who I don''t."
With this knowledge, sleeping was very calm and safe.

Goodnight, strong Hero. Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 11;

-- Story 12: The Emotion Band (Magic Stick for Two)
UPDATE program_stories SET full_text = E'Our Hero, {childName}, was walking through the forest and found a wonderful thing under a bush. It was a long, smooth, golden Stick.
It looked like a knight''s sword! Or a magic staff! Or a barrier gate!
"Wow!" the Hero was delighted. "Mine!"

But at the same second, Little Fox grabbed the stick from the other side.
"No, mine!" shouted Fox. "I saw it first!"

{childName} pulled the stick toward themselves. Fox pulled it toward himself.
"Give it!" shouted the Hero.
"I won''t!" puffed Fox.

Inside the Hero, the Red Spark (Anger) flared up. It became hot and big. They wanted to push Fox.
Fox also turned red and angry. He frowned and even flattened his ears.
They pulled so hard that dust flew from under their feet. Neither wanted to give in. And neither was having fun. It was hard, hot, and hurtful.

"Ahem-ahem," the Magical Backpack coughed politely. "Hey, friends! Right now you look like two angry crabs."
The Hero and Fox stopped, breathing heavily, but didn''t let go of the stick.
"Backpack!" {childName} complained. "Tell him to give it! This is my sword!"
"No, this is my barrier gate!" shouted Fox.

"Look," said the Backpack. "Now there''s one stick. And two of you.
If the Hero wins and takes the stick - Fox will cry. Blue Sadness will come to him.
If Fox wins - the Hero will cry.
Is that a good game when someone cries?"

"No," the Hero grumbled. "But I don''t want to give it up."
"You don''t have to give it up," the Backpack winked slyly. "Try to think of a game where the stick is needed by both of you at once."

The Hero thought. Fox also stopped pulling.
"Hmm... if one holds and the other jumps..." {childName} started thinking.
"Then it''s a jump rope!" Fox picked up.
They tried it. Fox spun the stick along the grass, and the Hero jumped over it. Hop! Hop! It was fun!

"And now let''s carry it together!" suggested Fox. "Like we''re firefighters carrying a hose!"
"Let''s!" agreed the Hero.
They took the stick from both ends and ran to "put out" the bush. Wee-oo-wee-oo!
The Red Anger instantly disappeared. Instead, Yellow Joy popped out. And not one, but two at once! One for the Hero, one for Fox.
They ran, laughed, and invented more and more new games: the stick became a bridge across a stream, then a ship''s steering wheel, then a stretcher for a wounded beetle.

When it was time to say goodbye, they put the stick under the bush.
"Tomorrow we''ll come back and play more!" they said in unison.

In the evening, the Hero was getting ready for bed.
"So, who won?" asked the Backpack.
"We both won," smiled {childName}. "Playing together is more fun than alone."
The Backpack approvingly fastened its straps.

Goodnight, wise Hero who knows how to be friends.
Goodnight, {childName}.' WHERE id = 12;
